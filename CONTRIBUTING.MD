## What is the contribution process?
1. **Issue:** Check repo for an _existing_ issue related to your contribution
   first. If none exist, open a new issue. 
2. **Development environment:** If you haven't already, fork and clone whichever
   repo you want to contribute to. Then, create a new branch and add your
   contribution in it.
3. **Pull request:** Submit a PR. Be sure to fill out the template properly.
4. **Approval:** Get PR approved by design and developers, or make any necessary
   changes for approval. This process may be quick or take a few iterations of
   feedback-update.
5. **Documentation:** After design and dev have approved and merged PR, update
   any website documentation if necessary. One of the best examples for this is
   if you're contributing to component work which has website documentation
   related to your contribution.

Here are some contribution quick tips:

- **Do** check repos for existing issues.
- **Do** fill out the required template for contributions entirely; this
  pertains to both issues and PRs.
- **Do** follow existing coding and writing styles.
- **Do** follow proper commit messages syntax.
- **Do not** branch off another branch.
- **Do not** include unrelated changes in the same PR.
- **Do not** create one massive PR if it can be broken up into smaller PRs.
