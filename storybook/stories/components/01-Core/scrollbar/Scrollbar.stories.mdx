# Scrollbar

Use the scrollable class when you need to provide scrolling within a section of a page.

For example, when the content within an element exceeds either the width or height of the element, applying `made-c-scrollbar` provides a vertical scrollbar, while `made-c-scrollbar--horizontal` adds a horizontal scrollbar.

`made-s-scrollbar` class is added for demo purposes.

⚠️ The `made-c-scrollbar` classes style the scrollbar using `made-c-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar` and `made-c-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb` which is not supported by the latest version of Firefox. The style will default to the OS scrollbar.

## Vertical

The `made-c-scrollbar` class adds vertical scrolling.
