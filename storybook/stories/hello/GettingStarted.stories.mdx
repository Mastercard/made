# Getting Started

## Install

Made for Developers packages can be downloaded via the <a href="https://github.com/Mastercard/made" target="_blank">Mastercard GitHub</a>.

Before moving further, please make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

If you're planning on using Made packages in a project that doesn't yet use Node Package Manager, you'll have to first create a package.json file. You can read more on how to do this in the npm documentation.

In order to install the Made for Developers packages first you must create a Personal Access Token. Follow the steps provided here in the GitHub Documention on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic" target="_blank">Creating a Personal Access Token</a>.

When creating the Personal Access Token, under the 'Select scopes' section make sure to check the 'write:packages' checkbox before clicking the 'Generate Token' button. Then once the token is generated make sure to copy the Personal Access Token somewhere as you will need it for the next steps.

Next in order to install the packages you need to authenticate to GitHub Packages by creating a _.npmrc_ file, this file will also be used to set the package registry to point to the GitHub Packages registry.

1. Create a file named _.npmrc_ in the root directory of your project (where package.json lives).
2. Add the following to the _.npmrc_ file, replacing _TOKEN_ with the Personal Acces Token created in the steps above:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=TOKEN
strict-ssl=false
@mastercard:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

To install the packages, run the following command(s) in your terminal in your project root directory (where package.json lives). This will install all of the packages into the node_modules/@mastercard/ directory.

```
npm install @mastercard/made-design-tokens@latest
npm install @mastercard/made-css@latest
```

If you get an error when trying to install the packages due to being on a restricted network you may need to configure a proxy for NPM. For more information about this please see the article here: <a href="https://medium.com/@d_dhana/working-with-npm-behind-network-proxy-444ced82a3" target="_blank">Working with NPM Behind a Network Proxy</a>

You can also download the assets in a zip or tarball file from the latest release on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Mastercard/made/releases" target="_blank">Made Releases</a>. The files are then found in _packages/made-css/dist_ and _packages/made-design-tokens/dist_.

### Usage

Once you’ve downloaded or installed the NPM package, you can copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-directory]/tokens.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-directory]/made.min.css" />
```

To import in SCSS, include this at the beginning of your main SCSS partial:

```
"[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-design-tokens/dist/2.1.1/web/themes/[theme-name]/tokens.css";
"[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/made.min.css";
```

You can also import the stylesheets with [CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties). 
<small><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=custom%20properties" target="_blank"> ⚠️ Note: IE11 does not support CSS variables</a></small>

`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/src/styles.css",`
`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/src/made-css-variables.css",`
`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/src/made-css-variables.min.css",`
