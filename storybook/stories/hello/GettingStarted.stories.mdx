# Getting Started

## Install

Made for Developers packages can be downloaded via the Mastercard GitHub.

Before moving further, please make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

If you're planning on using Made packages in a project that doesn't yet use Node Package Manager, you'll have to first create a package.json file. You can read more on how to do this in the npm documentation.

As Made. for Developers packages are hosted on the GitHub Packages you will need to to set your registry to point to the GitHub Packages repository.

To configure your project to use the GitHub Packages Registry run this the command line:

```
npm config set registry https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

This can be changed back to use the NPM Registry by running the command:

```
npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org
```

To install, run the following command(s) in your terminal in your project root directory (where package.json lives). This will install all of the packages into the node_modules/@mastercard/ directory.

```
npm install @mastercard/made-design-tokens@latest
npm install @mastercard/made-css@latest
```

### Usage

Once you’ve downloaded or installed the NPM package, you can copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-directory]/tokens.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-directory]/made.min.css" />
```

To import in SCSS, include this at the beginning of your main SCSS partial:

```
"[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-design-tokens/dist/2.1.1/web/themes/[theme-name]/tokens.css";
"[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/made.min.css";
```

You can also import the stylesheets with [CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties). 
<small><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=custom%20properties" target="_blank"> ⚠️ Note: IE11 does not support CSS variables</a></small>

`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/src/styles.css",`
`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/src/made-css-variables.css",`
`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/src/made-css-variables.min.css",`
