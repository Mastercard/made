# Getting Started

## Login

In order to download the Made for Developers packages first you must create a Personal Access Token. Follow the steps provided here in the GitHub Documention on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic" target="_blank">Creating a Personal Access Token</a>.

When creating the Personal Access Token, under the 'Select scopes' section make sure to check the 'write:packages' checkbox before clicking the 'Generate Token' button. Then once the token is generated make sure to copy the Personal Access Token somewhere as you will need it to log in to GitHub using the command line.

With your Personal Access Token now created open the command line window and navigate to the root directory of your project (where package.json lives). You will now need to authenticate by logging into NPM. Use the `npm login` command, replacing _USERNAME_ with your GitHub username, _TOKEN_ with your Personal Access Toke (paste in the token you generated earlier)n, and _PUBLIC-EMAIL-ADDRESS_ with your email address.

```
npm login
```

```
> Username: USERNAME
> Password: TOKEN
> Email: PUBLIC-EMAIL-ADDRESS
```

## Install

Made for Developers packages can be downloaded via the <a href="https://github.com/Mastercard/made" target="_blank">Mastercard GitHub</a>.

Before moving further, please make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

If you're planning on using Made packages in a project that doesn't yet use Node Package Manager, you'll have to first create a package.json file. You can read more on how to do this in the npm documentation.

As Made. for Developers packages are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/features/packages" target="_blank">GitHub Packages</a> you will need to to set your registry to point to the GitHub Packages repository.

To configure your project to use the GitHub Packages Registry run this in the command line:

```
npm config set registry https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

This can be changed back to use the NPM Registry by running the command:

```
npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org
```

To install, run the following command(s) in your terminal in your project root directory (where package.json lives). This will install all of the packages into the node_modules/@mastercard/ directory.

```
npm install @mastercard/made-design-tokens@latest
npm install @mastercard/made-css@latest
```

If you get an error when trying to install the packages due to being on a restricted network you may need to configure a proxy for NPM. For more information about this please see the article here: <a href="https://medium.com/@d_dhana/working-with-npm-behind-network-proxy-444ced82a3" target="_blank">Working with NPM Behind a Network Proxy</a>

You can also download the assets in a zip or tarball file from the latest release on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Mastercard/made/releases" target="_blank">Made Releases</a>. The files are then found in _packages/made-css/dist_ and _packages/made-design-tokens/dist_.

### Usage

Once you’ve downloaded or installed the NPM package, you can copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-directory]/tokens.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-directory]/made.min.css" />
```

To import in SCSS, include this at the beginning of your main SCSS partial:

```
"[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-design-tokens/dist/2.1.1/web/themes/[theme-name]/tokens.css";
"[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/made.min.css";
```

You can also import the stylesheets with [CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties). 
<small><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=custom%20properties" target="_blank"> ⚠️ Note: IE11 does not support CSS variables</a></small>

`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/src/styles.css",`
`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/src/made-css-variables.css",`
`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mastercard/made-css/dist/1.2.1/src/made-css-variables.min.css",`
