# What's New

## Controls

The Made team are delighted to announce the rollout of the first set of components making use of <a href="https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls" target="_blank">Storybook Controls</a> &#129395;

Made Form components now come with controls to give you a graphical UI to interact with the component dynamically without needing to code. For example you can now can easily change the state or label text of a checkbox component for demonstration purposes simply by clicking a button or changing a field. Over the coming months we will be adding in more of these so you can easily interact and customise the components to suit your needs.

## How to Use Controls

Simply click on a component that has been configured to use controls and you will see in the panel below it a number of controls that will allow you to modify how it looks in various states e.g. default, success, error. Or maybe you want to change the text of a form label or add more options to a select list. This can all be done now without having to write a single line of code.

## Benefits of Controls

The addition of controls to our components gives you the ability to:

-   Use your interactive stories in documentation, tests, and even in designs.
-   No coding knowledge required to generate a customised component.
-   Interactive data to suit your exact needs, e.g. add more checkboxes to a checkbox group.
