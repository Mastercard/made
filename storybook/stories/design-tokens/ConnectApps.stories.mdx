# Connect Apps

This section aims to provide a process that enables Connect App teams **who built their experience using MADE CSS components** to quickly test and confirm they are correctly integrated with design tokens.
> *Please note: this process will not work for those apps using other frameworks such as DXP, the Angular or React toolkits or experiences built with custom/homegrown components. 
Audit processes for those instances are coming soon*
 
# Testing with Made Test Theme tokens

The purpose of this section is to provide a process that enables engineers to easily test and confirm that experiences are correctly integrated with design tokens. 
 
## About the Made testing theme:

The testing theme is used to update the existing Mastercard branded token values with the testing token values provided. 
By swapping them out with the testing token values, Mastercard colors such as gray, black, and orange turn into different shades of blue and the Mastercard brand fonts turn into Arial. 
The shift in colors and styles allows developers to easily pinpoint areas that might have been missed when initially adding design tokens. 
By following the steps below, your team can quickly switch between the Mastercard branded theme and the Made testing theme.  

## Objective of testing

Once you have completed integration of Made tokens, you want to ensure that you have integrated tokens in all respective elements in the UI. 
Using this theme will provide the ability to test coverage and ensure the right tokens have been leveraged during integration.  


## How to test with Made testing theme: 

1. The Made test theme files are located [here](https://github.com/Mastercard/made/tree/main/assets/partnerbank-test-theme). Find the file type that is needed for your project, either .css/.scss, .less, or .json. 
    For example, use the tokens.css version of the Made test theme if your project uses CSS. 
2. You can choose to keep the name of the Made test theme file (tokens.css) or rename it to “made-test-theme.css". 
    The image below illustrates an example where the name of the file was changed to “made-test-theme.css".  
3. Import `made-test-theme` instead of the default Made Tokens into your global styles, and any of the tokens you've implemented will pull values from that Test Theme.  
Below is an example of CSS being used:

<img src={testTheme01} alt="Example of CSS being used" class="sb-vs-code-gif" />

4. After importing the Made test theme, your application styles will look blue. 
Every element that does not have that blue theme means that you’ve missed adding a design token to it. 
The benefit of using the Made test theme is that you can easily and quickly test that you’ve added design tokens to your application in the correct locations.

5. See below for test theme and after screenshots: 

Before: 

<img src={testTheme02} alt="Example, before applying testing theme" class="sb-vs-code-gif" />

After:

<img src={testTheme03} alt="Example, after applying testing theme" class="sb-vs-code-gif" />

## Applications behind Connect:

As part of the Connect Scorecard, applications must integrate with design tokens. The testing process above should be used to provide proof of token integration by app teams. 

 
Steps to provide proof of application token integration: 

1. Perform the steps above across multiple pages to demonstrate token integration.  

2. Capture screen shots of each page and leverage the template provided by the Connect team to provide before and after screenshots of your application with the theme applied 
__Note: We require you to input before and after screenshots of 90% of your application (e.g., if you have 10 routes / pages in your application, then please provide at least 9 before and after screenshots).__

3. Send completed template to [Hannah Chansler](mailto:hannah.chansler@mastercard.com?subject=Design%20token%20integration%20proof) with application name. Once document is reviewed, the scorecard will be updated with the correct score
