# Width

It's easy to make an element as wide as needed using our width classes. These classes use our size tokens and are based on multiples of 4px.

The classes are named using the format {namespace}-{prefix}-{property}-{scale} e.g. `made-u-width-1-x`

- Where namespace is `made`.
- Where prefix is `u` for utility (see naming conventions).
- Where property is `width`
- Where scale is defined as design tokens `1` to `20`.

There are also classes provided which allow percentage widths to be used. 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% and auto are supported. These classes are named using the format {namespace}-{prefix}-{property}-{percent} e.g. `made-u-width-25`, `made-u-width-50`, `made-u-width-auto`

## Responsive Breakpoints

Width classes can be made responsive by appending the breakpoint to the class. Two breakpoints are provided: `md` and `lg`. Customise your widths on small, medium and large devices.

For width classes using rems, examples would be `made-u-width-10-x`, `made-u-width--md-15-x`, `made-u-width--lg-20-x`. And for percentage width classes, examples would be `made-u-width-100`, `made-u-width--md-75`, `made-u-width--lg-50`.

- Device width is less than 600px wide no breakpoint needs to be appended to the class.
- Device width is 600px wide or more the `md` breakpoint can be appended to the class in order to use a different width at or above 600px.
- Device width is 960px wide or more the `lg` breakpoint can be appended to the class in order to use a different width at or above 960px.

The examples below show responsive classes applying a different width to elements at three different device widths. The first example shows width classes using rems, and the second shows width classes using percentages.
