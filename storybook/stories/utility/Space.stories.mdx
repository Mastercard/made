# Space

Our pre-defined spacing system makes it easier for designers and developers to maintain consistency across all applications.
When applied consistently, spacing creates a visual balance thatâ€™s easier for users to scan and engage with content.

## The Spacing System

We use a 4px spacing scale for components, typography and layout to give a predictable rhythm.

## Spacing Helper Classes

Made. provide developers with helper classes to give the flexibility to add required margins to Made. components.

The classes are named using the format {namespace}-{prefix}-{property}-{side}-{scale} e.g. `made-u-margin-top-1-x`

- Where namespace is `made`.
- Where prefix is `u` for utility (see naming conventions).
- Where property is `margin`
- Where side is one of `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right`,
- Where scale is defined as design tokens `1` to `20`.

### Margin

Margin helper classes are used in the examples below to add spacing between elements.

(Classes beginning with `made-s` are styled for demo purposes only and can be replaced with project code.)

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Margin Top">
    <div class="made-s-spacing">
      <div class="made-u-margin-top-1-x made-s-code-block"></div>
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Margin Right">
    <div class="made-s-spacing">
      <div class="made-u-margin-right-5-x made-s-code-block"></div>
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Margin Bottom">
    <div class="made-s-spacing">
      <div class="made-u-margin-bottom-10-x made-s-code-block"></div>
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Margin Left">
    <div class="made-s-spacing">
      <div class="made-u-margin-left-15-x made-s-code-block"></div>
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Responsive Breakpoints

Spacing classes can be made responsive by appending the breakpoint to the class. Two breakpoints are provided: `md` and `lg`. Customise your margins on small, medium and large devices.

- Device width is less than 600px wide no breakpoint needs to be appended to the class.
- Device width is 600px wide or more the `md` breakpoint can be appended to the class in order to use a different margin at or above 600px.
- Device width is 960px wide or more the `lg` breakpoint can be appended to the class in order to use a different margin at or above 960px.

Example below shows how these responsive classes can be used to apply different margin-top to an element at three different device widths.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Responsive Breakpoints">
    <div class="made-s-spacing">
      <div class="made-u-margin-top-1-x made-u-margin-top--md-2-x made-u-margin-top--lg-3-x made-s-code-block"></div>
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
